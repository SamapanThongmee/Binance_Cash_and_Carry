nixPkgs = ["python311", "python311Packages.pip", "gcc"]

[start]

```

**Or alternatively, delete `nixpacks.toml` entirely** and let Railway auto-detect Python. Just keep these files:

1. **requirements.txt** (same as before)
2. **runtime.txt** (same as before) 
3. **Procfile** - change to:
```
web: python main.py
